#   Mini game JavaScript 

A simple browser-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game created using vanilla JavaScript. The game runs on page load and interacts with the user via prompt and confirm dialogs.

##  How It Works

- On loading the page, the game starts automatically.
- The player is prompted to choose: `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- A random choice is made by the computer.
- The game declares the result as **win**, **lose**, or **tie**.
- If the player loses, the game restarts automatically.

##  Technologies Used

- **HTML** – for page structure
- **CSS (inline)** – for basic styling
- **JavaScript** – for game logic and interaction

## Files

- `index.html` – Displays a welcome message and includes the script
- `script.js` – Contains the full game logic

##  How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click **"OK"** to start the game.
3. Enter your choice when prompted.
4. See if you win, lose, or tie!

##  Educational Purpose

This project helps practice:

- Random selection from arrays
- Using `prompt()` and `confirm()` dialogs
- Basic game logic in JavaScript
- Recursive function calls for restarting
